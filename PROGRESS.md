# Unplugged — Build Progress

## What Has Been Completed

### Phase 1: Backend Scaffolding ✅

All foundational files created and verified. Server starts successfully, health endpoint responds, and SQLite database is created with all 7 tables.

#### Files Created:

**Infrastructure:**
- `backend/requirements.txt` — All Python dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlmodel, apscheduler, etc.)
- `backend/database.py` — SQLModel engine setup with SQLite, `get_session` dependency, `create_db_and_tables()`
- `backend/auth.py` — Bearer token auth middleware (skips auth if no API_KEY env var set)
- `backend/websocket.py` — `ConnectionManager` class with connect/disconnect/broadcast methods
- `backend/main.py` — FastAPI app with CORS, lifespan handler, health check endpoint, WebSocket endpoint, all routers registered
- `.env.example` — Template env file

#### Issues Fixed:
- Pydantic/SQLModel field name `date` clashed with the `date` type annotation — fixed with `import datetime as dt`
- SQLModel 0.0.37 `TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class` on `Literal[...]` fields — fixed by using `str` with `sa_column=Column(String)` in all affected model files
- `database.py` default path `sqlite:///backend/data/unplugged.db` — fixed to `sqlite:///data/unplugged.db` for correct relative path
- `model_dump()` returned non-serializable `dt.time` objects — fixed with `model_dump(mode="json")` across all API files

### Phase 2: Schedule Module ✅
### Phase 3: Meal Module ✅
### Phase 4: Budget Module ✅
### Phase 5: Scoring Module ✅
### Phase 6: Presence Module ✅
### Phase 7: Config & Schema Export ✅
### Phase 8: React Frontend ✅
### Phase 9: Docker + Deployment ✅

*(See git history for detailed file lists of Phases 2–9)*

---

### Phase 10a: Member Profiles ✅

- `backend/models/member.py` — Member, MemberCreate, MemberUpdate models
- `backend/api/members.py` — 5 endpoints: CRUD + per-member score breakdown
- `backend/models/__init__.py` — Updated with all new model exports
- `backend/main.py` — Updated with members_router, goals_router, chores_router

---

### Phase 10b: Personal Goals System ✅

- `backend/models/goal.py` — PersonalGoal, GoalCompletion, PersonalGoalCreate/Update, GoalCompleteRequest
- `backend/api/goals.py` — 6 endpoints: CRUD + complete + progress with streak tracking
- `backend/services/goal_tracker.py` — Streak detection (x1.5 at 3+ days), per-goal progress aggregation

---

### Phase 10c: Chore System ✅

- `backend/models/chore.py` — Chore, ChoreCompletion, ChoreCreate/Update, ChoreCompleteRequest

### Phase 10d: Scoring Engine — Per-Member Score ✅

- `backend/api/members.py` — `GET /members/{id}/score` endpoint returns breakdown by source (activities, goals, chores)
- Points now tracked individually per member via GoalCompletion and ChoreCompletion tables

**Note:** `backend/services/scoring_engine.py` still awards family activity points at the household level. Full refactor to award per-participant is deferred to when the Activity model adds a `participant_member_ids` field.

---

### Phase 10e: Schedule Locations + Travel Time ✅

  - `GET /schedules/member/{member_id}` — Per-member calendar view
  - `GET /schedules/travel-time` — Calculate travel time between locations
  - `POST /schedules/events/{id}/auto-travel` — Auto-set travel time from Google Maps

---

### Phase 10g: Enhanced CSV Import ✅

- `backend/models/csv_mapping.py` — CsvColumnMapping, CsvColumnMappingCreate models
- `backend/services/csv_importer_v2.py` — Enhanced parser with explicit column mapping, amount sign inversion, skip rows

  - `POST /budgets/csv-mappings` — Save a mapping profile
  - `POST /budgets/import-csv` — Now supports `mapping_id` query param for saved profiles
  - `POST /budgets/import-csv/preview` — Preview parsed rows before committing

---

### Phase 10f: Google Calendar Two-Way Sync ✅

- `backend/services/google_calendar.py` — OAuth2 flow (auth URL, code exchange, token refresh), two-way sync (import/export/update), disconnect
